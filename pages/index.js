      "Typically, customers who want to use our design skills will be happy to use a template for 2 reasons:<br/><br/>1. The website needs to be up and running quick.<br/>2. The website isnâ€™t complex - and money can be saved by using a template instead of developing a unique site from scratch.<br/><br/>Templates are just that - a template of a layout. Once your brand colours, images, text, and specific sections are added, the website will be unique to your brand as it should be.",
  },

    question: "What programs do you use?",

Each one of these templates serves a slightly different purpose - rest assured the right platform will be chosen to fit your website - should a template be most suitable.",
